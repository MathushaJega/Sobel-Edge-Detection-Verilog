# Sobel-Edge-Detection-Verilog
This Sobel Edge Detection project uses Verilog HDL for real-time image processing. It features a $3 \times 3$ convolution architecture verified against a Python "Golden Model" to ensure 100% accuracy. The system processes grayscale pixels in Vivado, extracting sharp edges and reconstructing the final image to validate the hardware logic
